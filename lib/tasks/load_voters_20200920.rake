His candidacy in the 2017 Congressional Special Election was the impetus for what became Postcards to Voters. We didn't call ourselves anything in particular as we began to form a nationwide postcard-writing \"army\" of 1,200 volunteer writers. It's poetic now that we are approaching 100,000 enrolled activists and we're writing for Jon again after nearly four years.\n\nHe's running for the U.S. Senate this time. A lot has changed in Georgia since his first campaign. Lucy McBath, you may recall, won the 6th Congressional District in 2018. And we all know how close Stacey Abrams came to becoming Georgia's Governor. We're voting now in a Presidential election during a pandemic and with memorials for Congressman John Lewis and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fresh. How will these and so many other conditions influence voters' choices this cycle? We're going to find out soon enough.\n\nBut, the one thing we can do to boost Democratic voter participation is to send them the very same kinds of fun, friendly election reminders that gave rise to this postcarding GOTV phenomenon. I was in my car when Jon called me a couple weeks ago to ask if we would write for him again. I live in the Georgia 6th Congressional District and remain a huge \"fanboy\" of his.\n\nEvery time he answers a question, I feel as if I am learning something new. As if he's bringing something to the discussion that isn't often considered. This campaign is personal to me because I live here. But, even for the majority of our writers who don't live in Georgia, I expect this race will be personal, too. For a variety of reasons.\n\nIt's my pleasure to skip over what are normally more detailed statements on the race, the stakes, and the challenges. We've been waiting to help Jon win and he reached out personally to make sure we knew how important our help figures in to his team's GOTV plan to win.\n\nEvery single address they need us to write is going to be loaded to Abby the Address Bot's database. Let's make this happen and bring this thing around full circle.\n\nWrite on!\n\n\nRead the Rules\n==========================\nAs a volunteer writer for Postcards to Voters, you agree to follow these rules:\n\n1. Handwrite your postcards legibly. Your message including the voter address must be written by hand each time on each card.\n2. Use cards that are inclusive. If you buy, print, or make postcards, the images/graphics/photos and wording/quotes/slogans should be issue-neutral/benign/safe and not depict any holiday.\n3. Mail completed postcards daily and complete them as quickly as possible by the listed deadline to allow your assigned voters time to plan to vote.\n4. Only sign your first name or initials. Do not include your return address, email address, last name, or social media handle or account name.\n5. Only write to each voter once. Do not contact the voters again for any reason.\n6. Cover addresses before taking photos. If you share digital photos of your cards on social media, always cover voters' addresses.\n7. Keep cards looking grassroots-like. Do not print logos/graphics/images/photos belonging to the candidate or campaign on the cards. Do not scan one handwritten card and reproduce by machine.\n8. Stick to the approved message items provided. Do not add new facts/instructions/warnings/anything not listed as an approved message item.\n9. Ask us if you have questions: Postcards@TonyTheDemocrat.org\n10. Have fun!\n\nRequired Message Items\n==========================\nThese exact message items must be written by hand on each of your cards, without exception:\n\nVote for Democrat Jon Ossoff to be your U.S. Senator.\nEarly Voting opens October 12th for the Nov. 3 election.\nHealth care, clean energy, and an economy that works for every Georgian.\n\nOptional Candidate Items\n==========================\nThese are some additional candidate items that you may pick and choose to round out your personalized, individually handwritten message to the voters. It all depends on the space you have on your card and how large you write. You may reword and even combine these optional items as long as their meanings remain the same.\n\nJon is running because:\n* Georgia needs leadership that puts Georgians first.\n* Georgia families and small businesses deserve a Senator who works as hard for them as they work to make ends meet.\n* There are common-sense steps we can take to keep Georgia families safe from gun violence.\n* Women, not the government, should control the private, personal, and complex decisions about their own bodies.\n* He will fight to increase funding for women's health clinics.\n* Race and class disparities in policing, prosecution, and sentencing must end nationwide.\n* He will work in the U.S. Senate to pass a new Civil Rights Act.\n* Climate change is real and poses a risk to our future.\n* He will lead to invest in infrastructure and clean energy.\n* Listening to science and medical experts will get this pandemic under control.\n* This pandemic reminds us how important health care is and he will fight to get every Georgian covered.\n\nWebsite: ElectJon.com\n#VoteYourOssoff\n\nWhat?

It's important that all optional items meet the same standard for positivity and inclusion that campaigns trust us to follow.

Email: Join@TonyTheDemocrat.org\n\nAddressing the Postcard\n==========================\nSince we do not write the voters' names, pick ONE of these or something similarly neutral/positive/encouraging:\nImportant Voter, VIP Voter, Best Voter Ever, Valued Voter, Essential Voter, Esteemed Voter, Much-Needed Voter, Partner in Democracy, Voter Friend, Terrific Voter, Awesome Voter, Patriotic Voter, Concerned Citizen, Defender of Democracy, Super Voter, Serious Voter, Responsible Voter, Winning Voter\n\nCommon Questions\n==========================\nQ1. The address looks like it is not in the voting area.\nA1. Voters can specify a different mailing address when they register to vote. We honor that request and mail to where they have asked even if it is not in the voting area. Use the address provided.\n\nQ2. The address is obviously incomplete.\nA2. Skip it. Do not email us. We will not be able to research it and correct it. That's the way it is in the voting data file from the state.\n\nQ3. There is a duplicate address.\nA3. Skip it. Do not email us. Sometimes a duplicate will slip by. We do not want you to send two postcards to the same address.\n\nQ4. I went back for more addresses for the same candidate and they aren't in the menu any longer.\nA4. That means we don't have any addresses for that campaign. Do not email us.\n\nQ5. I wrote extra postcards for a campaign and now they aren't listed any longer.\nA5. When we assign the last address, we remove the campaign from the menu. That means we don't have any more addresses. Please try not to write cards in advance without addresses assigned to you first.\n\nQ6. I have a great idea of something different to write on the cards that you didn't mention.\nA6. Please stick to the items mentioned above which have been approved. Do not add any facts, websites, phone numbers, instructions, slogans, warnings, polling place information, other election dates or deadlines, or any information about registering to vote or verifying registration. If it is not listed as an approved item to write, do not write it.\n\nQ7. I can't write my list of addresses after all.\nA7. Email the list number to Postcards@TonyTheDemocrat.org and will reassign the whole list. There is no way to reassign partially completed lists.\n\nQ8. I write with a group. How do I sign up if I want to be able to write on my own in between group events?\nA8. Take a picture of one of your written postcards and email it to us at: Join@TonyTheDemocrat.org\n\nAny other questions? Email: Postcards@TonyTheDemocrat.org\n\nRequired Message Items Reminder\n==========================\nProofread every card before you mail them. Especially if you had friends writing with you. Everyone can make a mistake. Please double check spelling, that the rules were followed, and that these exact message items are written by hand on each card, without exception:\n\nVote for Democrat Jon Ossoff to be your U.S. Senator.\nEarly Voting opens October 12th for the Nov. 3 election.\nHealth care, clean energy, and an economy that works for every Georgian.\n\nYour Assigned Addresses\n==========================\nThere's a reminder between addresses to help you avoid writing the wrong campaign's information on cards addressed to a different campaign. Do not write that reminder as part of the address. It's just there for you in case you have lists for multiple concurrent campaigns.\n", "created_at"=>"2020-09-24T01:02:24.910Z", "updated_at"=>"2020-09-24T01:02:24.910Z"}
